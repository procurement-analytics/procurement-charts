# Procurement charts
This script generates a set of JSON files that powers the [procurement dashboards](https://github.com/procurement-analytics/procurement-analytics). It is developed to work with the OCDS record packages that the Compranet to OCDS](https://github.com/procurement-analytics/compranet-data/) script generates, but may work with other record packages as well.
